                            Hi, I am Ahmad Malki, and this is my website.
                            I'm a 22 year-old Software Engineer and an ambitious Video Game Developer.
                            I was born and raised in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
                            My passion for video games started when I was as young as 6.
                            I've always dreamed of making my own video games. As well as becoming part of a huge project.
                            As I grew older I developed a love for creating software.
                            Whether it's an application, website, video game, or even just a simple simulation of a race between a hare and a tortoise, completing a project always brings me joy.
                            Throughout my years in university, I have been collaborating with my classmates in several minor projects. Having the ability to work with others is essential to a developer, and I certainly love exchanging knowledge with people around me.
